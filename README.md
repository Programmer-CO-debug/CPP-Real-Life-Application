# OOPS – Real-Time Examples

This repository contains C++ programs developed as part of the **Object-Oriented Programming with C++ (OOPs)** course. The programs demonstrate important Object-Oriented Programming concepts using simple and practical real-time examples.

The repository covers **Unit I, Unit II, and Unit III**, including classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, virtual functions, operator overloading, smart pointers, and input validation.

**Concepts Used:** Classes and Objects, Encapsulation, Private Data Members, Constructors, Constant Member Functions, STL Vector.

### 2. Student Attendance Tracker

A student attendance program that records attendance and calculates the attendance percentage based on total classes and attended classes.

**Concepts Used:** Classes and Objects, Encapsulation, Constructors, Constant Member Functions, Attendance Percentage Calculation.

### 3. Product Inventory Manager

An inventory management program that stores product ID, name, price, and stock. It maintains the total number of products using static members.

**Concepts Used:** Classes and Objects, Constructors and Destructors, Getter Functions, Static Data Members, Static Member Functions, Constant Member Functions.

### 🏠 Mini Project: Smart Home Manager

A menu-driven smart home management system that controls **Smart Light, Thermostat, Security Camera, and Door Lock**. Users can view the dashboard, turn devices ON/OFF, and change device status using the device ID.

**Concepts Used:** Inheritance, Protected Members, Virtual Functions, Function Overriding, Runtime Polymorphism, Virtual Destructor, Dynamic Memory Allocation, Menu-Driven Programming.

# 📗 Unit II – Programs

### 1. Employee Payroll System

A payroll system based on an abstract `Employee` class with **Full-Time Employee, Part-Time Employee, and Intern** types. Each type calculates salary differently.

**Concepts Used:** Classes and Objects, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Constructors with Initializer Lists, Abstract Classes, Pure Virtual Functions, Function Overriding, Salary Calculation.

### 2. Payment Gateway System

A payment gateway simulation supporting **Credit Card, UPI, and Net Banking**. Different payment methods are managed using smart pointers.

**Concepts Used:** Abstraction, Abstract Classes, Pure Virtual Functions, Inheritance, Function Overriding, Runtime Polymorphism, Virtual Destructor, Smart Pointers, STL Vector.

### 3. Vehicle Fleet Management

A fleet management system containing **Truck, Delivery Van, and Delivery Bike**. Each vehicle displays its own details through overridden functions.

**Concepts Used:** Inheritance, Protected Members, Virtual Functions, Function Overriding, Runtime Polymorphism, Virtual Destructor, Smart Pointers, STL Vector.

### 🏦 Mini Project: Banking System

A menu-driven banking system supporting **Savings, Current, and Fixed Deposit Accounts**. Users can enter account details, deposit money, withdraw money, display account information, and calculate interest.

| Account Type    |    Interest |
| --------------- | ----------: |
| Savings Account |          4% |
| Current Account | No Interest |
| Fixed Deposit   | 7% per year |

**Concepts Used:** Inheritance, Abstraction, Abstract Classes, Pure Virtual Functions, Virtual Functions, Runtime Polymorphism, Virtual Destructor, Dynamic Memory Allocation, Menu-Driven Programming.

# 📕 Unit III – Programs

### 1. Shape Area System

A shape area calculator using an abstract `Shape` class and derived classes **Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle**. Each shape calculates its area using runtime polymorphism.

**Concepts Used:** Abstraction, Abstract Classes, Pure Virtual Functions, Inheritance, Function Overriding, Runtime Polymorphism, Virtual Destructor, Smart Pointers, STL Vector.

### 2. Complex Number Operations

A complex number program that uses operator overloading to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and comparison.

Example:

```cpp
num1 + num2
```

**Concepts Used:** Operator Overloading `+`, `-`, `*`, `==`, Constructors with Default Arguments, Constant Member Functions, Returning Objects by Value.

### 3. Data Checker

A validation utility that checks real-life input rules such as marks between 0 and 100, valid transaction amounts, and names containing only letters and spaces.

**Concepts Used:** Classes and Objects, Input Validation, String Handling, `isalpha()`, Range-Based For Loop, Constant Member Functions.

### 🎵 Mini Project: Media Player

A media player simulation containing **Audio, Video, and Image** types derived from a common `Media` base class. Each type implements its own **play, pause, stop, and show-details** operations.

**Concepts Used:** Inheritance, Protected Members, Virtual Functions, Function Overriding, Runtime Polymorphism, Virtual Destructor, Dynamic Memory Allocation, STL Vector of Base-Class Pointers.
